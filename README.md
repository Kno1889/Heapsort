# Heapsort
As part of my Data Structures, Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics course in the 2020 Winter term, I was tasked with implementing a Binary 
Max Heap in order to apply the heapsort sorting algorithm on an array of Integers. 
This class includes a testing class that was given to us by the marking TA.
